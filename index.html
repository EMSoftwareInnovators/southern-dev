    <h1>A Dev Conference for a better community by an awesome community.</h1>

    <section class="mission" >
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to push the conversation of software development beyond the basics and push innovation in design, architecture, data storage, and technical leadership. We believe an annual conference is a way to begin these discussions that can carry over to our developer community, businesses, and organizations throughout the year to improve ourselves and by extension, our community.</p>
