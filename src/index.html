        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to push the conversation of software development beyond the basics and push innovation in design, architecture, data storage, and technical leadership. We believe an annual conference is a way to
          begin these discussions that can carry over to our developer community, businesses, and organizations
          throughout the year to improve ourselves and by extension, our community.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="conduct">
