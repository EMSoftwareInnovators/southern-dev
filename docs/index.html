        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to push the conversation of software development beyond the basics and push innovation in design, architecture, data storage, and technical leadership. We believe an annual conference is a way to
          begin these discussions that can carry over to our developer community, businesses, and organizations
          throughout the year to improve ourselves and by extension, our community.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="conduct">
        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
          gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), financial status, political views, or technology choices. We do not
          tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
